    "P_VALUE": "\nThis p-value indicates that there is approximately 12.8% chance that this value of t-stat can be obtained considering a null\nhypothesis. This feature therefore appers not to be statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, not even at a 90% \nconfidence level.\n",

    "LIMITATIONS": "\nThe homoscedasticity of the sample has not be verified. With high standar errors, it is likely that the features used in the\nregression show colinearity. Even though the r squared is valid, the coefficient of inference cannot be trusted. It is necessary\nto check the residuals distibution in case with need to use a non-parametric model, and remove non significant features until\nwe observe no colinearity.\n"
